**Note:**

> The repository is mainly built by the iShare team. We built the initial version, and you can still see the original version in Branch legacy.

#### Members

In the following members, we created the original iShare. Although we did not develop perfectly at first, we made a lot of efforts for it, so I would like to thank them for everything they have done for it. Now, version 1.0.0 has been released, but you can still look at our hard-working code on branch A
